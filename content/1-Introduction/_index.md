**VPC Dual Stack** An increasing number of organizations are adopting IPv6 in their environments due to the exhaustion of the public IPv4 space, the scarcity of private IPv4 addresses—especially in large-scale networks—and the need to provide services accessible to IPv6-only clients. An intermediate step toward full IPv6 support is the design of an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack architecture, which leverages both versions of the IP protocol simultaneously.

**Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)** is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. **Amazon ECR** supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM. This is so that specified users or Amazon EC2 instances can access your container repositories and images. You can use your preferred CLI to push, pull, and manage Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible artifacts.

**Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)** is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. As a fully managed service, Amazon ECS comes with AWS configuration and operational best practices built-in. It's integrated with both AWS tools, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry, and third-party tools, such as Docker. This integration makes it easier for teams to focus on building the applications, not the environment. You can run and scale your container workloads across AWS Regions in the cloud, and on-premises, without the complexity of managing a control plane.
